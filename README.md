🧠 Lung Disease Classification using Deep Learning (CNN)
A deep learning-based project for classifying lung diseases (specifically pneumonia) from chest X-ray images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) implemented in Python with Keras and TensorFlow.

🚀 Features
Detects pneumonia from chest X-ray images using CNN

Deep learning model trained on real medical imaging data

Uses Conv2D, MaxPooling, Dense, and Dropout layers

Binary classification: Normal vs Pneumonia

Can be extended to classify other diseases (COVID-19, TB)

Evaluation metrics (accuracy, loss) and results (Coming Soon)

Lightweight and efficient for academic or research use

from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPool2D, Flatten, Dense, Dropout

image_shape = (image_width, image_height, color_channels)

model = Sequential()
model.add(Conv2D(32, (3,3), activation='relu', input_shape=image_shape))
model.add(MaxPool2D(pool_size=(2,2)))

model.add(Conv2D(64, (3,3), activation='relu'))
model.add(MaxPool2D(pool_size=(2,2)))

model.add(Flatten())
model.add(Dense(128, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dropout(0.5))
model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))

model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])
